## Sentiment analysis for selected policy

"Government and public service delivery is taking place in a changed world. A significant level of social, economic and political activity is now happening on the internet. This work explores wheter social media data can improve the quality and timeliness of the evidence base that informs public policy. Can the myriad of human connections and interactions on the web provide insight to enable government to develop better policy, understand its subsequent impact and inform the many different organisations that deliver public services?" [Report for Social Media And Public Policy](https://www.alliance4usefulevidence.org/assets/Social-Media-and-Public-Policy.pdf)

The most powerful social insights presented by social media include those on:
- **Politics and trust** – social media contains a wealth of information about people’s engagement with mainstream politics, and how the government, police and other facets of the state are viewed across populations.
- **Sentiment and attitude** – social media provide access to population level data concerning sentiments and attitudes on all aspects of social, economic and cultural life. Analysis of this data that can help us predict social, political and/or economic actions. 
- **Health and well–being** – researchers can gain data about the health and well–being of people through social media at levels of detail and scale that were previously impossible.
- **Information diffusion** – social media is now central to the flow and spread of all kinds of information. Researchers can track these flows to understand how different types of knowledge gain currency and influence. 

In this work, we will use publicly aviable information on social media to study 1) how people's feeling and sentiment for the recent policies related to COVID-19, and 2) how the misinformation about COVID-19 will be diffused to impact the national healthcare system. All data used in this work comes from publicly available information on social media platform. The analytics results is for research usage only.

- Step 2: randomly selecting 1% instances (say 200) 
- Step 3: asking four assessors (two males and two females with different background) to label the selected instances. 
- Step 4: training a multi-class classifier using BERT or Bi-LSTM or Random Forest or Gradient Boosting, and then use the classifier to predict the pesudo label for all unlabelled instances. .
- Step 5: selecting another 1% unlabelled instances with the most uncentain prediction, and then go to Step 3 till K rounds (say K=5) or accuracy/precision/F1-score achieve the desired fiigure (say 80%). Different assessors in each round are preferred.
